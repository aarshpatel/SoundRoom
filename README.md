# SoundRoom

SoundRoom is a shared music platform that allows users to collaborate in creating playlists for situations like road trips or parties. The music plays on the hostâ€™s device, and additional participants can add songs, which get entered into a queue. Each song in the queue can be upvoted/downvoted, and the highest voted song gets played first.
